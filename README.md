## Overview

Explore the future of voting with our Blockchain Voting dApp, a developmental project designed for learning and experimentation in Solidity and smart contract technology. Currently a work in progress with additional features on the way, this smart contract is deployed on Sepolia testnet and is perfect for testing and educational purposes and is not intended for official use.

## Features

- **Decentralized Voting:** Utilize the power of blockchain technology for secure and transparent voting processes.
- **Testnet Deployment:** The smart contract is deployed on Sepolia testnet, providing a sandbox environment for experimentation.
- **Educational Purpose:** This project aims to provide insights into Solidity and smart contract development, perfect for educational purposes.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Stay tuned for updates and improvements as we continue to enhance the functionality and usability of the dApp.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**
- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Sepolia Testnet**

## Usage

- Clone the repository.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the development server with `npm start`.

Note: Page errors may occur while using this app. My next development priority is improving smart contract error handling. Please refresh the page if you encounter any errors until this issue is resolved. It is also strongly advised to terminate the current poll if it is in an active status by clicking on the "End poll" button. This should reset the app and prevent errors from occurring.

## Disclaimer

This dApp is intended for testing and educational purposes only. Do not use it for official voting purposes.
